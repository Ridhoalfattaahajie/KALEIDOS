# KALEIDOS
KALEIDOS was built on the belief that resilience must be adaptive. Instead of simply blocking threats, it learns, predicts, and transforms. This philosophy is reflected in how the system reacts to anomalies, embeds evolutionary logic into audits, and visualizes threat impact in ways that are intuitive and explainable.
